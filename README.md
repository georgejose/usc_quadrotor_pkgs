Utilizing a group of homogeneous robots to complete the task of building predefined structure has been an active research topic for some time. However, the most comprehensive research done so far is using ground robots. In this paper, aerial robots or quadrotors are used instead to collectively construct an architectural pattern. During this process, task allocation, path planning, and collision avoidance of each robot are accounted for distributedly in that each quadrotor takes control of its own task. The implementation is carried out on ROS with RVIZ as the frontend. Different instances of simulation were run with varied number of quadrotors and the result shows that the the time taken depends on both the number of quadrotors and the type of structure being built. Finally, future extension is discussed to make this system practical for real life use cases.
